Two years ago, there was an unexpected flood, which inundated the lodgings of the fruit pickers overnight. Some lost their belongings and a few were injured. The next two years, Ms. Russel took precautions during the rainy season so as to protect the workers’ lodgings against flooding. In those last two years, however, there was no flooding. Ms. Russel believes that there will be no flood this year. She hence decides not to install the temporary flood barriers this year, and uses a portion of the money budgeted for the flood barriers to refurbish the kitchens in the workers’ houses instead. . As during the previous years, the river’s water supply is low all season and it never overflows. The fruit pickers are glad that the money has been invested into the refurbishment of the kitchens.",

In order to make sure that the car is now safe, John decides to test it at full speed on a deserted road he takes every day to work. Since John has not seen another car on this road for the past years, he does not slow down at the four-way stop on the road. As usual there is no other car on the road. After testing the car, John gives the car back to his wife who can now safely use the car.",
