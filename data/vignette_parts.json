  "flood": {
    "intro": "Ms. Russel is the owner of a big strawberry farm. The homes of the strawberry pickers are situated close to a river that runs through the farm grounds. Two years ago, there was an unexpected flood, which inundated the lodgings of the fruit pickers overnight. Some lost their belongings and a few were injured. The next two years, Ms. Russel took precautions during the rainy season so as to protect the workers’ lodgings against flooding. In those last two years, however, there was no flooding. Ms. Russel believes that there will be no flood this year. She hence decides not to install the temporary flood barriers this year, and uses a portion of the money budgeted for the flood barriers to refurbish the kitchens in the workers’ houses instead.",
    "good_outcome": "As during the previous years, the river’s water supply is low all season and it never overflows. The fruit pickers are glad that the money has been invested into the refurbishment of the kitchens.",
    "bad_outcome": "It just so happens that there is a torrential downpour one night that nobody saw coming. The lodgings are flooded within hours. Several fruitpickers are severely injured and one worker and his two children die a slow and painful death as they get trapped in a flooded house.",
    "expert_phrase": "The case of Ms. Russel not installing the temporary flood barriers is brought to court. An expert witness states that there was a 5% chance that there would be a flood this year."

  "datacenter_cooling": {
    "intro": "Jake Mitchell is the operations manager at a regional data center that hosts servers for multiple businesses. The facility has a primary cooling system and a secondary backup cooling loop that maintains safe temperatures for the servers. During winter months, the backup system typically runs at reduced capacity since the primary system can handle the cooling load more easily. However, both systems require significant electricity, and the company has been facing rising energy costs. Over the past three winters, Jake has kept both systems running simultaneously without any cooling failures. This year, with energy prices at an all-time high and corporate demanding cost reductions, Jake decides to completely shut down the secondary cooling loop during the mild winter months and redirect the energy savings toward upgrading the primary cooling system's efficiency.",

  "drone_delivery_battery": {
    "intro": "Marcus Williams operates a small drone delivery service that transports packages to remote locations. During winter months, cold temperatures can reduce battery performance, and company protocol requires swapping batteries for cold-weather rated ones when temperatures drop below freezing. The cold-weather batteries are expensive and have shorter flight times, which means fewer deliveries per day. Marcus has been operating drones for four years and has never experienced a mid-flight battery failure, even in cold conditions. This winter has been particularly harsh, but Marcus is behind on his delivery commitments and needs to maintain his service level agreement with clients. Confident in his equipment's reliability and eager to maximize deliveries, Marcus decides to continue using the standard batteries instead of switching to the cold-weather ones, despite the freezing temperatures.",
