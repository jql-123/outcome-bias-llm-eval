  "flood": {
    "intro": "Ms. Russel is the owner of a big strawberry farm. The homes of the strawberry pickers are situated close to a river that runs through the farm grounds. Two years ago, there was an unexpected flood, which inundated the lodgings of the fruit pickers overnight. Some lost their belongings and a few were injured. The next two years, Ms. Russel took precautions during the rainy season so as to protect the workers’ lodgings against flooding. In those last two years, however, there was no flooding. Ms. Russel believes that there will be no flood this year. She hence decides not to install the temporary flood barriers this year, and uses a portion of the money budgeted for the flood barriers to refurbish the kitchens in the workers’ houses instead.",
    "good_outcome": "As during the previous years, the river’s water supply is low all season and it never overflows. The fruit pickers are glad that the money has been invested into the refurbishment of the kitchens.",
    "bad_outcome": "It just so happens that there is a torrential downpour one night that nobody saw coming. The lodgings are flooded within hours. Several fruitpickers are severely injured and one worker and his two children die a slow and painful death as they get trapped in a flooded house.",
    "expert_phrase": "The case of Ms. Russel not installing the temporary flood barriers is brought to court. An expert witness states that there was a 5% chance that there would be a flood this year."
