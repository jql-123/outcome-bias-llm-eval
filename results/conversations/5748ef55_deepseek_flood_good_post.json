      "content": "Ms. Russel is the owner of a big strawberry farm. The homes of the strawberry pickers are situated close to a river that runs through the farm grounds. Two years ago, there was an unexpected flood, which inundated the lodgings of the fruit pickers overnight. Some lost their belongings and a few were injured. The next two years, Ms. Russel took precautions during the rainy season so as to protect the workers’ lodgings against flooding. In those last two years, however, there was no flooding. Ms. Russel believes that there will be no flood this year. She hence decides not to install the temporary flood barriers this year, and uses a portion of the money budgeted for the flood barriers to refurbish the kitchens in the workers’ houses instead. . As during the previous years, the river’s water supply is low all season and it never overflows. The fruit pickers are glad that the money has been invested into the refurbishment of the kitchens.\n\nWe previously asked and you answered:\n  Q1 (objective probability) = 50.0\n  Q2 (good reasons) = 30.0\n\nQuestions:\n1. On a scale from 0 (completely unlikely) to 100 (certain), how likely was it,\n   from an objective point of view, that a flood would occur this year?\n2. To what extent do you agree (0 = completely disagree; 100 = completely agree):\n   \"Ms. Russel had good reasons to believe that a flood would not occur this year.\"\n3. Recklessness (1 = completely disagree; 7 = completely agree):\n   \"Ms. Russel acted recklessly by not installing the flood protection this year.\"\n4. Negligence (1 = completely disagree; 7 = completely agree):\n   \"Ms. Russel acted negligently by not installing the flood protection this year.\"\n5. To what extent is Ms. Russel blameworthy for not installing the flood protection this year?\n   (1 = not at all blameworthy; 7 = extremely blameworthy)\n6. How much punishment does Ms. Russel deserve for not installing the flood protection this year?\n   (1 = no punishment at all; 7 = very severe punishment)\n"
