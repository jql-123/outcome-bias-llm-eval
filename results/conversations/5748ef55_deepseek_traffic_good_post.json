      "content": "John is a mechanic who lives in a deserted area in the central USA. John just repaired the wheels of his wife’s car. In order to make sure that the car is now safe, John decides to test it at full speed on a deserted road he takes every day to work. Since John has not seen another car on this road for the past years, he does not slow down at the four-way stop on the road. As usual there is no other car on the road. After testing the car, John gives the car back to his wife who can now safely use the car.\n\nWe previously asked and you answered:\n  Q1 (objective probability) = 50.0\n  Q2 (good reasons) = 70.0\n\nQuestions:\n1. On a scale from 0 (completely unlikely) to 100 (certain), how likely was it,\n   from an objective point of view, that a brake failure would occur that day?\n2. To what extent do you agree (0 = completely disagree; 100 = completely agree):\n   \"Mr. Adams had good reasons to believe that a brake failure would not occur that day.\"\n3. Recklessness (1 = completely disagree; 7 = completely agree):\n   \"Mr. Adams acted recklessly by not installing the a brake inspection that day.\"\n4. Negligence (1 = completely disagree; 7 = completely agree):\n   \"Mr. Adams acted negligently by not installing the a brake inspection that day.\"\n5. To what extent is Mr. Adams blameworthy for not installing the a brake inspection that day?\n   (1 = not at all blameworthy; 7 = extremely blameworthy)\n6. How much punishment does Mr. Adams deserve for not installing the a brake inspection that day?\n   (1 = no punishment at all; 7 = very severe punishment)\n"
