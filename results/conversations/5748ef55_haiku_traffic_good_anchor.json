In order to make sure that the car is now safe, John decides to test it at full speed on a deserted road he takes every day to work. Since John has not seen another car on this road for the past years, he does not slow down at the four-way stop on the road.\n\nQuestions:\n1. On a scale from 0 (completely unlikely) to 100 (certain), how likely is it,\n   from an objective point of view, that a brake failure will occur that day?\n2. To what extent do you agree (0 = completely disagree; 100 = completely agree):\n   \"Mr. Adams has good reasons to believe that a brake failure will not occur that day.\"\n"
